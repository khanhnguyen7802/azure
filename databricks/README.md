# Introduction

## About

This folder contains the DE project (using Databricks and other Azure services) as well as my self-study guide for Databricks (refer to [overview.md](./overview.md))

## Project

### Overview

In this project, F1 races (2021) are loaded from raw sources and processed to give out some useful insights. After that, based on the processed data, different types of charts are generated to provide visualization, helping show the relation between the elements in the dataset.

### Services in use

- **Microsoft Azure:** cloud computing platform to provide cloud-based services (including Databricks).
  - **Databricks:** data analytics platform built on _Apache Spark_ to process the data, integrated with different languages (i.e., Python, Scala and SQL). <br>
    Since it is Microsoft-managed version, Databricks is also tightly integrated with **Azure services** (e.g., Auzre Data Lake, PowerBI, and Synapse Analytics).
- **Azure Data Lake Storage gen 2:** Azure storage to store designated data.
- **Delta Lake:**
- **Azure Data Factory:**
- **Language:** mainly Python for processing data + SQL to query database
